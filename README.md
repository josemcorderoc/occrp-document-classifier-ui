- Validation of input (max size/num of pages/format)
- Write some things:
    - How to understand the thresholds, why sometimes all numbers are zero
    - CNN
    - Which classes do we distinguish
- test mobile version (at least the information should look more or less look okay)
- set up Google Analytics. Add cookie banner and info on imprint page
- add imprint page
- add JPG support
- predicted other vs. predicted 0 have to be more clear in chart and bar chart
- columns in table and bar chart more clear
- when clicking on multiple Details, only one bar graph should be visible at one time
- design bar chart (probabilites in %, center bar chart)
- expand/collapse table has to be layouted (paddings) and is buggy at the moment, first time it doesn't collapse. When closed it should only read Expand, otherwise Collapse.
